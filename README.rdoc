== README

This is a tool do search multiple key words (and common Ruby-ish variations) across multiple folders.

Things to note:

* version: 0.1.0

* Ruby version 2.1.5, Rails 4.1.2, Sqlite 3

* Typical usage would probably be:
  * Create a 'GrepMultis' record (which in turn creates various records in the other tables).
  * Go to the 'index' page for 'FoundFiles' and review the sorted results.
  * Occasionally, click 'CleanDb' and then go back to 'GrepMultis'.
